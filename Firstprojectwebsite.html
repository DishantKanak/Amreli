    <h2>It is believed that during 534 AD Amreli existed was formerly known as <mark> Anumanji, Amlik and then Amravati. </mark> <br>The
        city is <em><u> named in ancient Gujrati as Amarvalli. </u></em> It is learnt from the inscription in the Nagnath temple that
        ancient name of Amreli city was Amarpalli. <br> It was also called Girvanvalli. Amongst the remains of the ancient
        town are the memorial stones or paliya and foundations discovered <br> in the fork of the Thebi and Vari rivers, and
        two old temples, Kamnath and Trimbaknath, on the west and east of the river. <br>

        In the eighteenth century only the west and south of modern Amreli, still called Juni or Old Amreli, were
        inhabited. <br> <mark>The old inner fort, called Juna Kot, was used as a jail, and the Juna Masjid near it, belong to the
        old town.</mark> Modern Amreli dates from 1793,<br>when Vakhatsingh of Bhavnagar sacked the neighboring Kathi possession
        of Chital and drove many of its people to Amreli and Jetpur. <br>
